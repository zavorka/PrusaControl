### Translations
If you want to create translation of PrusaControl, to your native language, you can. First, check if your language is not in folder **ts** or in **pull request** section. If you find pull request, of your language, please review it. We are not able to check every language and we will accept only translations reviewed by some other translator.

For translating to new language, make **fork** of PrusaControl repository. Create new file in **ts** folder by copy/rename of file **en_US.ts** and use it as example. Its XML file with simple structure. Please, try to make same long strings as in English translation and be careful on space/tab symbols. You can use tool Qt Linguist for edit and generating binary version .qm of translation. For testing, you have to add binary (.qm) file to translation folder and add new language identifier to controller.py file in dict self.enumeration(around line 92). **When you are done, create pull request only from new .ts file.**
